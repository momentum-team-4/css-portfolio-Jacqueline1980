<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page! My name is Jacqueline Williamson and I am a software developer (in-training).
    Prior to this, I spent upwards of 16 years in the telecommunications and IT industry.  My career
    started in circuit design and I moved into network engineering.  From there, I found an affinity for the security aspect of 
    engineering.  I spent 5 years supporting large enterprise customers and maintaining their equipment.
    Now that you know the techie-work side of me, here is a quick intro to the personal me!
    I have been married for 13 years and have an awesome 8 year old son.  I also have two stepsons - one who is 27 and lives in Japan, 
    and another who is 23 and lives in San Diego.  I love to cook and bake in my spare time, which no one ever seems to complain about! :)
    I'm also committed to working out and do strength training, amongst other types of workouts, daily. </p>
