<h1><strong>Jacqueline Williamson</strong></h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page! My name is Jacqueline Williamson and I am a software developer (in-training).
    Prior to this, I spent upwards of 16 years in the telecommunications and IT industry.  My career
    started in circuit design and I moved into network engineering.  From there, I found an affinity for the security aspect of 
    engineering.  I spent 5 years supporting large enterprise customers and maintaining their equipment.</p>
    <p>Now that you know the techie-work side of me, here is a quick intro to the personal me!
    I have been married for 13 years and have an awesome 8 year old son.  I also have two stepsons - one who is 27 and lives in Japan, 
    and another who is 23 and lives in San Diego.  I love to cook and bake in my spare time, which no one ever seems to complain about!
    I'm also committed to working out and do strength training, amongst other types of workouts, daily. </p>
