<h1>Project Page</h1>

<p>Links to a few of my projects can be found here:</p>

<P>This first project was to demostrate html concepts and the purpose was to build out a 3 page website for a small Nursery Business.</P>
<p>You can check out the project work here: <link src="https://github.com/momentum-team-4/html-small-business-website-Jacqueline1980.git"></p>

<p>This second project, is a "work in progress."  The purpose was to build out a website adoption page for a shelter and add CSS to get that page 
    looking more "presentable."  There will be future updates.
